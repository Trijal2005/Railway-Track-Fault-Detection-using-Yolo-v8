# Railway-Track-Fault-Detection-using-Yolo-v8
This repository contains a project focused on detecting faults in railway tracks using machine learning. The objective is to classify tracks as either defective or non-defective based on input data.

## Project Structure
- **Railway_Track_Fault_Detection.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for model training, evaluation, and analysis.
- **config_track.yaml**: Configuration file specifying model parameters and settings.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect faults in railway tracks. By analyzing input data, the model aims to classify tracks as defective or non-defective with an accuracy of **62.18%**. 
This solution is designed to improve railway maintenance efficiency by identifying potential faults early, reducing the risk of accidents and costly repairs. The project includes a configurable setup and outputs example classifications for demonstration.

## Performance Summary
- **Total Predictions**: 119  
- **Correct Predictions**: 74  
- **Overall Accuracy**: 62.18%
